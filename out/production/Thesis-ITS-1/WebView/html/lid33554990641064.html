	                    	<p class="text"><b>Object Oriented Programming</b>(OOP) is a programming model where programmers focuses not only on the data structures, but also the type of operations(methods) that can be applied to the data structure. </p>

                            <ul style="font-family:Segoe UI;text-align:justify;">
                              <li><b>Objects</b> are the key to understanding <i>object-oriented programming</i> and the best way to understand how it works is by observing real-world objects.</li>
                              <li>A radio is an  <span style="color:#B71C1C">object</span>. Its states would be on/off, current volume, current station, AM/FM, etc. and its behavior or functions that will make use or change the states would be turn on/off, increase volume, decrease volume, seek, scan, and tune.</li>

                              <li>Software objects are conceptually similar to real-world objects: they too consist of state and related behavior. An object stores its state in fields (<span style="color:#B71C1C">variables</span>) and exposes its behavior through  <span style="color:#90CAF9">methods</span>. </li>
                            </ul>

                            <p class="text">Another important concept of OOP is the <b>Class</b>. In the real world, you'll often find many individual objects all of the same kind. There may be thousands of other radios in existence, all of the same make and model. Each radio was built from the <i>same set of blueprints and therefore contains the same components</i>. </p>

                            <p class="text">In object-oriented terms, we say that your radio is an <i>instance of the class of objects</i> known as radios. A class is the <b>blueprint</b> from which individual objects are created. It can also be thought of as your implementation of the object</p>
