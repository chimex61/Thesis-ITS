                             <p class="text"><b>Polymorphism</b> is generally, the ability to appear in many forms. In object-oriented programming, polymorphism refers to a programming language's ability to process objects differently depending on their data type or class. More specifically, it is the ability to redefine methods for derived classes </p>

The characteristics of the parent, beautiful eyes, short temper, peculiar head shapes, are inherited by the child and aside from these characteristics the child has other unique characteristics.</p>

                        <p class="text"><b>Encapsulation</b> is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming. It is a mechanism in Java where the variables and methods are wrapped together as a single unit. In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. </p>

                        <p class="text">Think of it as a pill, the case is the encapsulation and the content are the data and methods.To encapsulate the data or hide the data, set the variables as private. When set as private, it can only be accessed through the methods of the class which are called setters and getters </p>

                        <p class="text">Thanks for bearing with this system. Although this module seems rushed, this is actually the core part of Object Oriented Programming which is rather intermediete in terms of difficulty. Hence, we did not elaborate further. We hoped that you enjoyed learning with our system! The exam for this module will consists from Modules1~Modules6 and some from this module... </p>
