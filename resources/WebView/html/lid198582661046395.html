	                    	<p class="text">One of the most popular programming languages is the <b>Java</b> programming language. It was originally developed by Sun Microsystems initiated by James Gosling and released in 1995 as core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform.</p>

	                    	<p class="text">So, the question is, why Java?</p>

	                    	<p class="text">Ranging from software development, mobile applications, and large systems development, Java opens a number of opportunities for aspiring developers and experienced developers alike.</p>

	                    	<p class="text">While these may seem daunting, it is also important to at least familiarize with some technical and boring stuff (You may skip these terms except for <b>Object Oriented</b> and <b>Class</b>):</p>

							<div class="panel">
							  <p class="text">Java makes an effort to eliminate error prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time(when code is converting to machine code), error checking (incorrect syntax), and runtime checking (when the program is running).</p>
							</div>

							<button class="accordion">Multithreaded</button>
							<div class="panel">
							  <p class="text">With Java's multithreaded feature it is possible to write programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously. This design feature allows the developers to construct interactive applications that can run smoothly.</p>
							</div>

							<button class="accordion">Platform Independent</button>
							<div class="panel">
							  <p class="text">Unlike programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled (converted to machine code),it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.</p>
							</div>

							<button class="accordion">Interpreted</button>
							<div class="panel">
							  <p class="text">Java byte code is translated on the fly to native machine instructions and is not stored anywhere. The development process is more rapid and analytical since the linking is an incremental and light-weight process.</p>
							</div>

							<button class="accordion">High Performance</button>
							<div class="panel">
							  <p class="text">With the use of Just-In-Time compilers (when the program runs), Java enables high performance.</p>
							</div>

							<button class="accordion">Distributed</button>
							<div class="panel">
							  <p class="text">Java is designed for the distributed environment of the internet.</p>
							</div>

							<button class="accordion">Simple</button>
							<div class="panel">
							  <p class="text">Java is Object Oriented Programming(OOP). Learning Java can enable you to master other OOP languages.</p>
							</div>

							<button class="accordion">Object Oriented</button>
							<div class="panel">
							  <p class="text">In Java, everything is an Object. For example in a real world scenario, a dog has states/characteristics - color, name, breed as well as behaviors - wagging the tail, barking, eating. Additionally, it is an instance of a class. <br><br>

							<button class="accordion">Class</button>
							<div class="panel">
							  <p class="text">A Class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type supports. <br>
